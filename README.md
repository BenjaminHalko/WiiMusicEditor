## Section 2 - Help
### - Creating custom songs for Wii Music
To start creating songs, you'll need a .midi file.
You can easily look up a MIDI for a song. Just search that song and add MIDI to the search terms.
Once you've found a MIDI that you want to use, you'll need to check if it's Wii Music-ready. Unfortunately, there are some limitations. Here's what's needed to quality for a Wii Music-ready song:
- The MIDI MUST have 4 tracks.
- The MIDI CANNOT be above a certain file size (File sizes depend on the songs).
